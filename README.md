## Summary:
- Since we designed text box for entries, user needs to know the dataset before hand and enter it rather than selecting through a list of distinct values. 
- Recommendations:
	- In this case a drop-down would work best with a list of distinct values to choose from
	- Clear All button would work best since each time the user needs to clear his selection.
	- Export button to download data to a txt file or excel file.
